This is where you find the BORING rules. Before I get a friend to write down the rules in depth, all you need to think is 'I steal, I get hurt, I go to jail' `r emo::ji("wink")` 

Rules:
-do not steal

-do not make a mess

-do not fight anyone. This is an all peace territory

-do not ruin the cakes or you will get banned.

-lastly, do NOT anger Wisely
